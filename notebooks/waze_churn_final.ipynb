    "Waze is seeking to improve its user retention by identifying users likely to churn. As a data analyst on the team, I conducted an end-to-end analysis using the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) framework. The goal is to develop a churn prediction model and offer actionable insights for stakeholder decisions.\n",

    "## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand user behavior contributing to churn  \n",
    "- Perform hypothesis testing and regression analysis  \n",
    "- Build a machine learning classification model to predict churn  \n",
    "- Provide clear insights and recommendations to reduce churn\n",
